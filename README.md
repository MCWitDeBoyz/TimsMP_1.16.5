# TimsMP_1.16.5

Summary:
Github is a version control & collaboration tool. We'll be using this to keep up our miencraft up as much as possible by using multiple of our PC's whenever one of us is on.
For example instead of using just my PC we may be using mine, Westin's, and Tim's. Therefore when any of us are on we can run the server. 
This github will allow hosts to pull an updated version the server on their local machine and push the updated version again after playing for next time and to continue the cycle.


Host First time Setup:


1.) Port forward 25565 to be able to host MC server (unless you already have)

2.) Download, install, create account - Github desktop app

3.) @Nipz your GH username through discord to give you access on GitHub (you will have to accept)

4.) @Nipz your public IP Adress from the website IPCHICKEN

5.) Open GitHub Desktop & clone this repo URL: MCWitDeBoyz/TimsMP_1.16.5 (Once cloned you should be able to make changes and see updates.)


You are now setup. 

Overview:


Current Repository - this should never change and should say "TimsMP_1.16.5"

Current branch - This shouldn't change and should say "main"

Fetch origin - Something you will routinely use to get the update version of the server.

Changes tab - This will show you changes made in the server on your local machine. This should have changes after you are done hosting the server after playing.

History - this should show all server changes from each host on the github.

Summary, Description, Commit to main (bottom left) - Something you will routinely use to update the server after done playing. The summary should be in the format of DD/MM - HOUR:MINUTES AM/PM (ex. 4/24 - 2:19 PM)


Routine:


Before playing: Click on "Fetch Origin" to update the server 

To play: Click "Repository" at the top of Github, click "Show in Explorer", click on "DeBoyz" folder, then click "run.bat." Two windows will open, cmd and MC server interface.

After playing: You can check to make sure everything is working by refreshing the changes and verifying that local file server changes have been made. We must upload these so that everyone will have an updated server. Make sure you are on the changes tab and add a Summary(refer to template above),Description(Optional), and click "Commit to main." Afterwards you will see something like "Push to origin/remote branch." CLICK THIS BUTTON OR ELSE THE CHANGES WILL NOT BE UPLOADED 

Now you are finished and the next person can complete the same routine.
